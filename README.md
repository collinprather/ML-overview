# ML-overview
A wide overview of the field of Machine Learning. 
Intended to leave you fluent enough in machine learning concepts and lingo to develop 
some intuition into what problems could be solved using machine learning, where it 
could be integrated into our current projects, and give you some direction if you 
decide that you'd like to learn more.
